# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `mysql -u root -p`

Type `mysql -u root -p` to access the MySQL CLI using your password.

In the MySQL CLI, type `create database todos;` to create a database in MySQL.

Run the following in the MySQL CLI: `ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD';` (replace `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your actual password)

Run `node model/database.js` in your **TERMINAL**, in the **project** folder (not your MySQL CLI! Open a new terminal window for this). This will create a table called 'items' in your database.

### Run Your Development Servers

- Run `npm start` in project directory to start the Express server on port 5000
- `cd client` and run `npm start` to start client server in development mode with hot reloading in port 3000.
- Client is configured so all API calls will be proxied to port 5000 for a smoother development experience. Yay!
- You can test your client app in `http://localhost:3000`
- You can test your API in `http://localhost:5000/api`

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
